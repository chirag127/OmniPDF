## Project Overview
OmniPDF is a user-friendly web application designed to offer a comprehensive suite of tools for managing and manipulating PDF documents. The primary goal is to provide a convenient, accessible, and cost-effective one-stop-shop for individuals and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) who frequently work with PDFs. The application will initially focus on the most commonly used PDF functionalities, with a plan to incrementally add more specialized tools. It aims to simplify document workflows, enhance productivity, and eliminate the need for expensive desktop software for many common PDF tasks.

## Project Goals
- To provide a reliable and easy-to-use platform for common PDF operations.
- To offer a core set of high-demand PDF tools (Merge, Split, Compress, Edit, Sign, Convert) in its initial version (MVP).
- To ensure user privacy and data security, especially when handling uploaded documents.
- To build a scalable and performant application capable of handling a growing user base and processing demands.
- To gather user feedback on the initial set of tools to guide future development and feature prioritization.
- To eventually expand the toolkit to cover a wide array of PDF-related functionalities, becoming a go-to resource for PDF management.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React (using Vite for build tooling), JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS recommended for styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js with NestJS framework (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for user accounts and related data, if optional accounts are implemented). For file processing, primarily in-memory or temporary storage.
- **PDF Processing Libraries**:
    -   **Client-side (for performance & privacy on simpler tasks)**: `pdf-lib.js` (manipulation, creation), `PDF.js` (viewing, rendering).
    -   **Server-side (for complex tasks & broader compatibility)**: `pdf-lib` (Node.js), potentially supplemented by robust CLI tools like `Ghostscript` or `qpdf` (via child processes, ensuring license compatibility) for specific complex operations (e.g., advanced compression, PDF/A conversion if added later). Library selection will be finalized per-feature based on capability and licensing.
- **Job Queue (for asynchronous server-side processing)**: BullMQ (with Redis)
- **Deployment**:
    -   **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify
    -   **Backend**: Render, Heroku, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk (using Docker containers)
    -   **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., Neon, Supabase, AWS RDS, Render PostgreSQL)

## Testing Strategy
-   **Unit Tests**: Jest (for both frontend React components/hooks/utils and backend NestJS services/controllers). Focus on individual functions and modules.
-   **Integration Tests**: For backend, test interactions between modules (e.g., controller-service-database). For frontend, test component compositions. `testing-library/react` for frontend components. Supertest for NestJS API endpoints.
-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Playwright or Cypress to simulate user flows across the entire application (e.g., uploading a file, performing a merge, downloading the result).
-   **Manual Testing**: For UI/UX checks, cross-browser compatibility, and exploratory testing.
-   **Code Coverage**: Aim for >80% coverage for critical modules.

## Deployment Strategy
-   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
    -   On push to `develop` branch: Run linters, unit tests, integration tests. Build artifacts.
    -   On merge to `main` branch (or tag): Deploy to production.
-   **Frontend**: Deploy static build (from `npm run build` with Vite) to Vercel or Netlify. Connect to Git repository for automatic deployments.
-   **Backend**: Containerize the NestJS application using Docker. Deploy the container to a PaaS like Render, Heroku, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
-   **Database**: Use a managed database service (e.g., Render PostgreSQL, AWS RDS, Neon, Supabase).
-   **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Utilize blue/green deployment strategies or rolling updates if supported by the PaaS for backend services.
-   **Environment Configuration**: Manage environment variables securely through the deployment platform's settings.

## Maintenance Plan
-   **Monitoring**: Implement logging (e.g., Winston/Pino for backend, Sentry for frontend/backend error tracking) and application performance monitoring (APM).
-   **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies (OS, language, frameworks, libraries) updated to patch security vulnerabilities and leverage new features. Schedule regular review and update cycles.
-   **Backups**: Regular automated backups for the database (if user data is stored).
-   **Bug Fixing**: Prioritize and address bugs based on severity and user impact.
-   **User Feedback Loop**: Establish a channel for users to report issues and suggest features. Regularly review feedback to guide ongoing development.
-   **Documentation Updates**: Keep README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and any internal design documents current with changes.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality & Design Principles
-   Follow industry-standard coding best practices (clean code, modularity, error handling, security, scalability).
-   Apply SOLID, DRY (via abstraction), and KISS principles.
-   Design modular, reusable components/functions.
-   Optimize for code readability and maintainable structure.
-   Add concise, useful function-level comments.
-   Implement comprehensive error handling (try-catch, custom errors, async handling).

### Frontend Development
-   Provide modern, clean, professional, and intuitive UI designs.
-   Adhere to UI/UX principles (clarity, consistency, simplicity, feedback, accessibility/WCAG).
-   Use appropriate CSS frameworks/methodologies (e.g., Tailwind CSS is recommended, or BEM if using plain CSS/SASS).

### Data Handling & APIs
-   Integrate with real, live data sources and APIs as specified or implied.
-   Prohibit placeholder, mock, or dummy data/API responses in the final code.
-   Accept credentials/config exclusively via environment variables.
-   Use `.env` files for local secrets/config with a template `.env.example` file.
-   Centralize all API endpoint URLs in a single location (config file, constants module, or environment variables in frontend).
-   Never hardcode API endpoint URLs directly in service/component files.

### Asset Generation
-   Do not use placeholder images or icons.
-   Create necessary graphics as SVG and convert to PNG using the sharp library if raster formats are needed.
-   Write build scripts (e.g., in `scripts/generate-assets.js`) to handle asset generation.
-   Reference only the generated PNG files (or SVGs directly) within the application code.

### Documentation Requirements
-   Create a comprehensive README.md including project overview, setup instructions, environment variable guide, and how to run/test the application. Add last updated date and time using `date_and_time_mcp_server.getCurrentDateTime_node`.
-   Maintain a CHANGELOG.md to document changes using semantic versioning.
-   Document required API keys/credentials clearly in `.env.example` and README.md.
-   Ensure all documentation is well-written, accurate, and reflects the final code.

### System & Environment Considerations
-   Target system: Windows 11 Home Single Language 23H2.
-   Use semicolon (`;`) as the command separator in PowerShell commands, not `&&`.
-   Use `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "path1", "path2", ... -Force` for creating directories in PowerShell.
-   Use language-native path manipulation libraries (e.g., Node.js `path`) for robust path handling.
-   Use package manager commands via the `launch-process` tool to add dependencies; do not edit `package.json` directly.

### Error Handling & Debugging
-   First attempt to resolve errors autonomously using available tools.
-   Perform systematic debugging: consult web resources, documentation, modify code, adjust configuration, retry.
-   Report back only if an insurmountable blocker persists after exhausting all self-correction efforts.

## Conclusion
This masterplan outlines the development of "OmniPDF - All-in-One PDF Toolkit," a web application aimed at providing a comprehensive suite of PDF tools. By focusing on an MVP with core functionalities and progressively adding features based on user feedback, OmniPDF can become a valuable and widely-used resource. Adherence to the technical guidelines, robust testing, and a phased implementation approach incorporating advanced reasoning (MCP) tools will be key to its success. The plan emphasizes user experience, security, and scalability to build a reliable and maintainable product.
